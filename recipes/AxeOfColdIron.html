		</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A forge lit by the fire of a Red Dragon</li>
			<li>20 kilograms of high quality Iron</li>
			<li>The last breath of an Ice Giant</li>
			<li>A hammer</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Ponder the metal for a few weeks, feeling it's pattern, veins and wants.</li>
			<li>Convince it to accept a new shape. Warmth (such as produced by the forge)
				may help, along with whispers of promises, kind words as to its nature,
				and general good natured exchanges. Some may react well to goat cheese.</li>
			<li>Fold your metal a hundred time, and a hundred time again.</li>
			<li>Consider a career change as you eat the leftover goat cheese.</li>
			<li>Set the shape of the metal with vigorous hammer strikes.</li>
			<li>Plunge in the breath of the giant (or a bucket of cold water).</li>
		</ol>>
